# Medical Image Test Data

This repository aims to source medical images for BHKLAB
radiomics test data.

[Releases](https://github.com/bhklab/med-image_test-data/releases)

See [this issue on Med-ImageTools](https://github.com/bhklab/med-imagetools/issues/173)
for the discussion.

Ideally, the results of this pipeline should be version controlled
and set up as release artifacts on GitHub.
